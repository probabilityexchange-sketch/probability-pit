# Module 2: The "Inch-Wide, Mile-Deep" Strategy

Here's an uncomfortable truth about prediction markets: you will never out-research a full-time political analyst on presidential elections. You will never out-model the National Weather Service on hurricanes. You will never out-scoop Bloomberg on Fed rate decisions.

And that's fine. Because you don't have to.

## The Trap of High-Volume Markets

The most liquid markets—presidential elections, Super Bowl winners, Fed rate decisions—have the most sophisticated participants. Hedge funds, polling aggregators, professional forecasters. They have Bloomberg terminals. They have Twitter bots scraping news in milliseconds. They have PhDs.

You are not beating them on speed. You are not beating them on data access. You are not beating them on modeling sophistication.

But here's the secret: these markets represent maybe 5% of prediction market volume. The other 95%? **Nobody is paying attention.**

## The Inch-Wide, Mile-Deep Philosophy

The winning strategy is not to know a little about everything. It's to know **everything about almost nothing**.

Pick a niche. A tiny, overlooked, illiquid corner of the prediction market world. And become the world expert on that specific thing.

Examples:
- State-level judicial elections in Ohio
- Snowfall totals in Buffalo, NY
- GitHub commit frequency for specific crypto projects
- FDA approval timing for rare disease drugs
- County-level ballot measure outcomes

These markets exist. They have liquidity—sometimes thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. But almost nobody is doing serious research on them.

## Information Asymmetry

In prediction markets, you profit from **information asymmetry**—when you know something the market doesn't.

In high-volume markets, information asymmetry lasts milliseconds. In niche markets, it can last hours or days.

A local news story about an Ohio judicial candidate's scandal might not reach the broader prediction market for 48 hours. If you're following local Ohio politics closely, you have a 48-hour edge.

## The 7-Day Specialty Challenge

Here's how to find your niche:

**Days 1-2**: Browse prediction markets across all platforms. List every market with under $50,000 in volume but at least $1,000. These are "liquid enough but ignored."

**Days 3-4**: For each candidate market, ask: Do I have—or can I get—access to information sources that most traders don't? Local newspapers, niche forums, industry publications, academic papers, GitHub repos.

**Days 5-6**: Pick ONE market. Set up your information feeds. Create a monitoring system. Read everything published about this topic in the last month.

**Day 7**: Paper trade for a week. Track your predictions vs market movements. Are you seeing things before the market does?

## Niche Selection Criteria

Good niches have:
1. **Local information**: News that doesn't travel fast nationally
2. **Technical complexity**: Requires domain knowledge to interpret
3. **Low participant sophistication**: Mostly retail traders, no hedge funds
4. **Predictable resolution**: Clear outcomes, no ambiguity
5. **Recurring events**: You can build expertise that compounds

Bad niches have:
1. **Pure speculation**: No underlying data to research
2. **High volatility**: Prices move randomly without information
3. **Ambiguous resolution**: Market might not resolve cleanly
4. **Insider dominance**: Someone with private info is already trading

## The Compound Knowledge Effect

Here's the beautiful thing about deep niches: your knowledge compounds.

After 3 months of following Ohio judicial elections, you know:
- Which pollsters are reliable
- How local endorsements move numbers
- The historical patterns of turnout
- Which reporters have good sources
- The funding patterns that predict outcomes

A new trader entering this market has none of this. You have a structural edge that grows over time.

## Core Concepts

### Local Information Asymmetry

Information travels at different speeds through different networks. National news is instantaneous. Local news can lag by days.

**Your goal**: Be on the faster network.

Types of local information:
- Regional newspapers (not national wire services)
- Local TV station websites
- County clerk filings
- State legislative calendars
- Specialized industry publications
- Academic preprint servers
- GitHub commits and issue discussions

### Niche Selection Framework

Score each potential niche (1-5) on:

| Criterion | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Info access | Can you get data others can't? |
| Participant sophistication | Are you competing with pros or amateurs? |
| Resolution clarity | Will the market resolve cleanly? |
| Recurrence | Can you reuse your expertise? |
| Liquidity | Is there enough money to make it worth it? |

Target niches that score 4+ on info access and participant sophistication, and 3+ on the others.

### Edge Decay and Niche Rotation

Edges don't last forever. As you trade a niche profitably, others may notice. Liquidity increases. Sophistication improves.

Signs your edge is decaying:
- Prices move faster on news you used to see first
- Volume increases without corresponding volatility
- Market comments show higher sophistication

When edge decays below 2× vig, **rotate to a new niche**. Take your research methodology with you.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Choosing niches based on interest, not edge**  
   You might love NBA basketball. But NBA markets are efficient. Your passion doesn't create information asymmetry.

2. **Spreading too thin**  
   Following 20 niches superficially is worse than following 1 deeply.

3. **Ignoring liquidity**  
   A perfect niche with $100 in volume isn't tradeable. You need enough liquidity to enter and exit positions.

4. **Overestimating your edge**  
   Test with paper trading first. If you can't predict better than the market in simulation, you won't in reality.

## Practice Exercise

1. Go to Kalshi and filter for markets under $10,000 volume
2. List 10 markets that you could plausibly research deeply
3. For each, identify 3 information sources that most traders probably don't follow
4. Pick the most promising and spend 1 hour researching it
5. Write down your probability estimate and reasoning
6. Check back in 1 week—did the market move toward or away from your estimate?

## Key Takeaways

- You can't beat sophisticated participants in high-volume markets
- Profitable edges exist in overlooked, illiquid niches
- Deep expertise in one area beats shallow knowledge everywhere
- Information asymmetry is your only sustainable advantage
- Edges decay; be ready to rotate niches
